== About files ==

This files were used to generate a drupal code swarm video which include
many users per commit based on log attribution.

- `drupalcodeswarmlog.py`:
The script that writes codeswarm xml.

- `drupal.config`:
Codeswarm configuration file to generate the png's.

- `drupal7-git-logs.xml`, `drupalfull-git-logs.xml`:
Generated xml for D7 branch and the whole drupal history using
`drupalcodeswarmlog.py`.

- `generatevideo.sh`:
Make an flv video based on codeswarm generated PNGs

== How to use this ==

. Get a drupal git repo from drupalfr:
git://git.drupalfr.org/git/core/main.git

. Generate the xml for codeswarm:
+
[source,sh]
----
python drupalcodeswarmlog.py \
           -o drupal7-git-logs.xml \

NOTE: `703488e5c5daf2c917c2d114d7946bc3a206519d` is the commit before D7
start, so you need to pass
`703488e5c5daf2c917c2d114d7946bc3a206519d..master` to get D7 development
history. you can also pass any other `<since>..<until>` that git-log can
accept. You can also use `master` to get full history.
