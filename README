= Drupal drupal contribution analyzer =

This set of scripts tries to get statistics from the drupal project
commit history.
It also tries to get as much as possible attribution in commit messages
as possible.

== Requirements ==

* git
* autotools
* python
* python-git
* codeswarm and mencoder (if you want to generate the video)
* asciidoc

== How to use this ==

First, you need to get a drupal git repo from drupalfr
`git://git.drupalfr.org/git/core/main.git`
and configure accordingly the `config.mk` file.

=== Tag cloud ===

To generate a tag cloud of file activity, using http://www.wordle.net you
need to:

. Generate the log file:
+
[source,sh]
----
make filelog-count
----

. Go to http://www.wordle.net/advanced and paste the contents of the file
in the first box.

. Make it pretty with the applet options.

NOTE: You can get a PDF of the tag cloud and then import it from inkscape
to generate the image size you need ;-)

=== Codeswarm ===

To get a codeswarm video of drupal history your need to:

. Generate the xml files for codeswarm:
+
[source,sh]
----
make mainlogs
----

. Get codeswarm: http://codeswarm.googlecode.com/

. Build code_swarm with ant.

. Copy the xml file you just generated to the `data/` directory in the root
of code_swarm.
+
NOTE: `make mainlogs` actually generate two xml files, so please repeat
this process if you want a video for Drupal 7 development and another one
for the full history of Drupal development.

. Copy `drupal.config` to the root of code_swarm.

. Make sure the InputFile variable in `drupal.config` have the right value
set(the xml file you just generated)

. Generate the frames for the video
+
[source,sh]
----
cd path/to/code_swarm
./run.sh drupal.config
----

. Copy `generatevideo.sh` to the `frames/` directory of code_swarm

. Make the video
+
[source,sh]
----
cd frames/
./generatevideo.sh drupal7-git-logs.flv
----
